#^ Exercises
# All exercises have been inspired from code throughout the notebook.
# There is one exercise per major section.
# You should be able to complete them by referencing their specific section.
# Note: For all exercises, your code should be device agnostic (meaning it could run on CPU or GPU if it's available).

#? 1. Create a straight line dataset using the linear regression formula (weight * X + bias).
#? - Set weight=0.3 and bias=0.9 there should be at least 100 datapoints total.
#? - Split the data into 80% training, 20% testing.
#? - Plot the training and testing data so it becomes visual.
